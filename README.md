# The Zeppelin Game

### Ludum Dare 46
[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) is a game jam competition. It was founded by Geoff Howland and was first held in April 2002. It is currently run by Mike Kasprzak, who has been part of the team since the beginning. Participants are required to create a video game that fits within a given theme in two or three days. 

[Ludum Dare 46](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/) took place from Saturday April 18th to Tuesday April 21st, 2020.
As I was just 16 yo and I had some experience developing simple games with Unity before, I decided to give it a try. 
It was my first ever game jam tbh. The theme for it was "keep it alive".

Regardless of my young age and little experience I completed the project in time. 
I developed my first game, that people actually were able to play and enjoy.
